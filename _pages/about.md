I'm a PhD student in statistics at Northwestern University. Previously, I earned my M.S. in statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. During my masters, I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Claudia Sol√≠s-Lemus. This work was focused on Bayesian regression approaches to network regression with applications to networks generated from microbiome phylogenetic distances. I'm also interested in tree and network analysis more generally, as well as longitudinal study results. 
I grew up in southeastern Michigan and earned my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Michigan in 2018. Before I started graduate school I worked as a software developer at a large electronic medical records company doing application development for laboratories. I also like data visualization, and niche application development. 

In my free time I like to bike, play softball, and take pictures of birds.
