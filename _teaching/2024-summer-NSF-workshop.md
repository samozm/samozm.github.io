            From [the workshop webpage](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/events/workshops-training/improving-evaluations-2024.html): This five day summer institute introduced early-to-mid career STEM education resarchers to contemporary evaluation methods for small-efficacy studies. This included 
            <ul>
                <li>An introduction to causal inference methods, confounding, and validity concerns in research</li>
                <li>Methods for matching to control for selection bias</li>
                <li>Pretest, posttest and difference-in-difference designs</li>
                <li>Small field experiments and pilot study designs</li>
            </ul>
            My role included facilitating a small group of 6 workshop participants as they critiqued and improved a previously published small-efficacy study.
