            From [the workshop webpage](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/events/workshops-training/cluster-randomized-trials-2024.html): The purpose of this training is to prepare current education researchers to plan, design, conduct, and interpret cluster-randomized trials. The goal of the course is to enable participants to: 
            <ul>
                <li>Describe the principles underlying randomized experiments and their advantages for making causal inferences.</li>
                <li>Understand the hierarchical structure of populations in education (students nested in classes nested in schools) and its implications for study design and analysis of data.</li>
                <li>Select appropriate measures for assessing outcomes, describing implementation fidelity, and capturing process variables.</li>
                <li>Acquire knowledge and strategies for designing and conducting a cluster-randomized trial.</li>
            </ul>
            My role included facilitating a small group of 6 workshop participants as they prepared an outline and presentation proposal for a grant from IES.
